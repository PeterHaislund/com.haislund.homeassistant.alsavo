# com.haislund.homeassistant.alsavo

Debian Docker image that publishes states from an Alsavo Heat Pump (taken from the Alsavo Pro Cloud Server) to MQTT and a description of how to configure Home Assistant to use the values.

The Docker image uses a compiled version of AlsavoCtrl developed by Mikko Strandborg - [GitHub link](https://github.com/strandborg/AlsavoCtrl).

# Docker container
An already build image is available at Docker Hub: peterhaislund/alsavo_status

## Logging
Logs are written to /data/alsavo_status.log so mapping the /data directory to the Docker host might be a good idea.

## Configuration
Configuration can be done either by a config file or by using environmental variables when creating the container.

The image will however always use the config file, so if using environmental variables a default config will be automatically created.

### Config file
The config file is located in /data/config.json, so mapping the /data directory to the Docker host is highly recommended to avoid loosing any changes to the default config.
By using the config file it is possible to retrieve data from multiple heat pumps.

A small example of a config:
```
{
    "publish_interval": "300",
    "log_size": "1000",
    "mqtt": {
        "server": "192.168.2.56",
        "server_port": "1883",
        "server_user": "None",
        "server_password": "None"
    },
    "heatpumps": [
        {
            "serial": "XXXX",
            "password": "XXXX",
            "topics": [
                {
                    "type": "status",
                    "index": 16,
                    "topic": "stats/pool/water_in_temp",
                    "mappings": []
                },
                {
                    "type": "status",
                    "index": 17,
                    "topic": "stats/pool/water_out_temp",
                    "mappings": []
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Topics in the config have the following purpose:
- type: Type of entry from the Alsavo heat pump
- index: Index value from the Alsavo heat pump
- topic: Topic to publish to MQTT
- mappings: Transformation rules to apply (see below)

See the protocol description in AlsavoCtrl to map type/index to parameters.

#### Mappings
2 kinds of mappings can be applied:

**Replace**
Simply replaces a value with another, example:
```
                    "mappings": [
                        {
                            "type": "replace",
                            "replacements": [
                                {
                                    "from": "0",
                                    "to": "Silent"
                                },
                                {
                                    "from": "1",
                                    "to": "Smart"
                                },
                                {
                                    "from": "2",
                                    "to": "Powerful"
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
```

**Eval**
Runs a transformation of the value (Python eval() function), example:
```
                    "mappings": [
                        {
                            "type": "eval",
                            "formula": "value/10"
                        }
                    ]
```

***Note***
_You can define multiple rules that will be applied one after another._

### Environmental variables
Can be set while creating the docker container through -e variables.

#### mqtt_server
Server/IP adress of MQTT Broker to publish to

#### mqtt_server_port
*[optional, default 1883]* Port number for MQTT Broker

#### mqtt_server_user
*[optional]* User for MQTT Broker

#### mqtt_server_password
*[optional]* Password for MQTT Broker

#### alsavo_serial
Serial number for the Alsavo heat pump (find it by clicking on the top-right logo in the Alsavo Pro app)

#### alsavo_password
Password for the Alsavo heat pump

#### publish_interval
*[optional, default 300]* Number of seconds between each status publish

#### log_size
*[optional, default 1000]* Number of log lines to retain in data/alsavo_status.log

## Running container
Example of creating/running the container:

```
docker image pull peterhaislund/alsavo_status
docker create -e alsavo_serial=XXXXXXXXX -e alsavo_password=XXXXXX -e mqtt_server=192.168.1.128 -e TZ=Europe/Copenhagen --name alsavo_status peterhaislund/alsavo_status
```

It is recommended to map the /data directory in the container to the Docker host.

# MQTT

## Topics
Topics are configured in /data/config.json, but default values (when configuration is done through environmental variables) are:
- stat/pool/water_in_temp
- stat/pool/water_out_temp
- stat/pool/ambient_temp
- stat/pool/fan_speed
- stat/pool/heating
- stat/pool/target_temp
- stat/pool/power_mode

# Home Assistant Configuration
Make sure you have installed [MQTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/) in Home Assistant and it is connected to the MQTT Broker.

Manually create sensors for representing each value published through the MQTT Broker.

As an example: In configuration.yaml add the following (remember to restart afterwards):

```
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "Pool Heater - Water In Temperature"
