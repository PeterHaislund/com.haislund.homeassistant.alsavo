In LAN mode, the heat pump answers to UDP port 1194. In global mode, server IP is 47.254.157.150 and UDP port 51192

All traffic is in big endian.

Packet header format:
int8    header code: 0x32 = request, 0x30 = reply to an earlier request of the same sequence number
int8    padding
int8    sequence number (monotonically increasing once session has been set up, otherwise 0)
int32   csid (session identifier, provided by server at login)
int32   dsid (device identifier, provided by server at login)
int16   command category: 0xf2 = login and authentication messages, 0xf3 = status and keepalive, 0xf4 = normal commands once session has been set update
int16   payload length in bytes (the length of the rest of the packet)
int8    "action" = command. 8 = Object query, 9 = set object value, 7 = connection reset (cmd == 0xf3 in this case), 0xb = status update from server (initiated by the server, client needs to reply)


Different payloads:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5: Authentication messages. Look into source code to see the contents.

8: object query / response
===============
int8    action = 8
int8    number of objects to query / respond to
int16   pad
<object payloads, starting with object header>

Object header:
int32 object type: only known one is 0x0002002e for status/config data.
int16 object subtype: for status/configs 1 = status, 2 = configs, 3 = deviceInfo?, 0xffff queries for all params and configs.
int16 object payload size. For queries this is 0, responses have payload data after this one.

For param/config data the object payload layout:
int16 startIdx
int16 numIndices
<numIndices x int16> parameter values. See below for param/config indices

0xb: Status update
===================
Layout identical to command 8, except that this is sent periodically by the server, containing status params (basically 0xb, 1, 0, 0, followed by object header for 0x0002002e with subtype 1)



Status params:

Values are signed int16s.
All temperature values are in tenths of a Celsius, for example a value of -123 means -12.3 degrees C.

16 = Water in temp
17 = Water out temp
18 = Ambient temperature
19 = "Cold pipe temperature"
20 = "Heating pipe temperature"
21 = IPM module temperature
22 = Fan speed (RPM)
23 = Exhaust temperature
24 = Compressor input temperature? Always zero for me.
25 = Electronic exhaust valve opening setting, Range: 0-450'ish
26 = Compressor current in amps
27 = Compressor running frequency
33 = Compressor speed setting (0 = off, 1 = P1 40Hz, 5 = P5 82Hz)
34 = Frequency limit code
48 = Alarm code 1
49 = Alarm code 2
50 = Alarm code 3
51 = Alarm code 4
52 = System status code (0 in heating operation)
53 = System running code (3 = heating operation, 2 = defrost)
54 = Device status code (231 = heating operation, 175 = defrost)
55 = Heating max temperature
56 = Cooling min temperature
64 = Device type
65 = Main board HW revision
66 = Main board SW revision
67 = Manual HW code
68 = Manual SW code

Config params:

1 = Heating mode target temp
2 = Cooling mode target temp
3 = Auto mode target temp
4 = System config bitmask 1 (See below)
5 = System config bitmask 2 (See below)
6 = Manual frequency setting
7 = Manual EEV setting
8 = Manual fan speed setting
9 = Defrost in temp
10 = Defrost out temp (Heating pipe temperature required to end defrost)
11 = Water temperature calibration (offset for all temperature measurements)
12 = Defrost in time (minimum time between defrost sequences, in minutes)
13 = Defrost out time (max defrost time?)
14 = "Hot over", looks like temperature, but without x10? Default value 30
15 = "Cold over" default -20
16 = Power mode (0 = silent, 1 = smart 2 = powerful)
17 = Unknown, default value 6
32 = Current time, hibyte=hours, lobyte=minutes
33 = Timer on time
34 = Timer off time

Sys config 1:

Bits 0-1:   Operating mode: 0 = cool, 1 = heat, 2 = Auto
Bit 2:      Timer on enabled
Bit 3:      Water pump running mode (see manual, 0 = heat pump controls water pump, 1 = always on)
Bit 4:      Electronic Valve style ?
Bit 5:      On/off
Bit 6:      Debug mode (0 = auto, 1 = manual config C6, C7, C8 in effect)
Bit 7:      Timer off enabled

Sys config 2:
Bit 0:      Manual Defrost
Bit 1:      Reset to factory settings OR set Valve mode, you'll never know!
Bit 2:
